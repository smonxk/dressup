		<Name>Avalon</Name>
		<Description>
			Although Avalon often hides away in the mysterious chambers of grand libraries, he never misses an opportunity to flaunt his opulence and verbosity at cultural gatherings. His charm and cunning have enchanted more than one guest at extravagant balls. There isn’t a soul who can out-talk him—how infuriating that can sometimes be! Yet, while Avalon may seem excessively talkative and frivolous among people, he cannot tolerate a single distracting whisper during his explorations of ancient academic texts.

			Those who truly know Avalon would describe him as more enigmatic and contemplative than the jovial socialite with a friend at every corner. Perhaps this is why he dresses so darkly and mysteriously... like a cunning moth flitting among a kaleidoscope of vibrant, carefree butterflies.
